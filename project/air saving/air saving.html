            <h1> Minimize air pollution from cars</h1>
            <p>Road transportation is one of the biggest emitters of nitrogen oxides. Oxides of nitrogen <br>
            are closely monitored air pollutants with an adverse effect on the healthy lung development<br>
            and the overall lifetime expectancy.</p>
            <p class="p2">
            Drive less by combining trips, telecommuting, carpooling, or carsharing. A great idea<br>
            is to bring your lunch to work, so you do not have to drive out during the lunch break,<br>
            or agree with your co-workers on going to get lunch together. Do not speed up or drive <br>
            aggressively because that only produces more emissions. Therefore, the most effective strategy to<br>
            keep the air clean is to avoid driving your car when possible.</p>

            <h1>Recycle and buy recycled products</h1>
            <p>magine all complex processes needed to create new items from scratch. You need to begin <br>
            with mining for raw materials. Mined materials then need to be transported, cleaned from <br>
            impurities, processed and treated until they can finally be transformed into desired products.<br>
            Each stage of the manufacture from raw materials is accompanied by emissions of polluting particles,<br>
            heavy metals, chemicals and greenhouse gases.</p>
            <p>
            Since recycled products have already been extracted and processed once, manufacturing <br>
            the same products the second time is much less-energy intensive and polluting.

            <h1>Plant trees</h1>
            <p>Trees around your house and in your neighborhood help reduce air pollutants significantly. <br>
            Researchers from the University of Southampton measured the ability of trees in London to remove <br>
            particulate pollutants from the air. Their findings were truly astonishing. Trees remove between 850 <br>
            to 2,000 tons of harmful particles from the urban air each year</p>
            <p>Except of removing the particulate matter, trees also decrease levels of nitrogen dioxide, <br>
            sulphur dioxide, carbon dioxide and monoxide, ozone, benzene and dioxin.</p>
