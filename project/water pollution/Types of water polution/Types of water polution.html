                <p>Industrial and agricultural work involves the use of many different
                  chemicals that can run-off<br> into water and pollute it.
                  Metals and solvents from industrial work can pollute rivers and lakes.
                  <br>These are poisonous to many forms of aquatic life and may slow their 
                  development, make them infertile or even result in death.<br><br>
                  Pesticides are used in farming to control weeds, insects and fungi.
                  Run-offs of these pesticides can cause <br>water pollution and poison aquatic life.
                   Subsequently, birds, humans and other animals may be poisoned if they
                    eat infected fish.<br><br>Petroleum is another form of
                   chemical pollutant that usually contaminates water through oil spills when a 
                   ship ruptures.<br> Oil spills usually have only a localised affect on wildlife 
                   but can spread for miles.<br> The oil can cause the death of many fish and stick to 
                   the feathers of seabirds causing them to lose the ability to fly.</p>
