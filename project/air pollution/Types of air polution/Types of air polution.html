                <h1 class="h1">The burning of fossil fuels</h1>
                <p>Sulfur dioxide emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal, <br>
                    petroleum and other factory combustibles are one the major cause of air pollution. <br>
                Pollution emitting from vehicles including trucks, jeeps, cars, trains, airplanes cause an immense amount of pollution. <br>
                We rely on them to fulfill our daily basic needs of transportation.</p>

<h1>Agricultural activities </h1>
        <p>Ammonia is a very common byproduct from agriculture-related activities and is one of the most hazardous gases in the atmosphere.<br>
         Use of insecticides, pesticides, and fertilizers in agricultural activities has grown quite a lot. <br>
         They emit harmful chemicals into the air and can also cause water pollution.<p>

  <h1>Mining operations</h1>
  <p> Mining is a process wherein minerals below the earth are extracted using large equipment. <br>
      During the process dust and chemicals are released in the air causing massive air pollution.<br> 
      This is one of the reasons which is responsible for the deteriorating health conditions of workers and nearby residents.</p>

  <h1>Volatile organic compounds</h1>
  <p>VOCs are an important outdoor air pollutant. In this field they are often divided into the separate categories of methane (CH4) and non-methane (NMVOCs). <br>
      Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming.<br>
      Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases via their role in creating ozone and in prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere, <br>
      although the effect varies depending on local air quality.<br>
     Within the NMVOCs, the aromatic compounds benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukaemia through prolonged exposure.1,
      3-butadiene is another dangerous compound which is often associated with industrial uses.</p>
