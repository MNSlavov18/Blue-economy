                <h1 class="h1">Chemical Water Pollution</h1>
                <p>Industrial and agricultural work involves the use of many different
                  chemicals that can run-off<br> into water and pollute it.
                  Metals and solvents from industrial work can pollute rivers and lakes.
                  <br>These are poisonous to many forms of aquatic life and may slow their 
                  development, make them infertile or even result in death.<br><br>
                  Pesticides are used in farming to control weeds, insects and fungi.
                  Run-offs of these pesticides can cause <br>water pollution and poison aquatic life.
                   Subsequently, birds, humans and other animals may be poisoned if they
                    eat infected fish.<br><br>Petroleum is another form of
                   chemical pollutant that usually contaminates water through oil spills when a 
                   ship ruptures.<br> Oil spills usually have only a localised affect on wildlife 
                   but can spread for miles.<br> The oil can cause the death of many fish and stick to 
                   the feathers of seabirds causing them to lose the ability to fly.</p>

<h1>Oil Pollution</h1>
                   <p>Everyday, oceans are heavily polluted with oils derived from oil spills, 
                    dumping, run-offs, and shipping.<br> In fact, an estimated 706 million gallons 
                    of waste-oil enters the ocean each year.<br><br> As the oil is not able to dissolve 
                    in water, it develops into a thick sludge that harms fish, affects marine birds, 
                    and blocks light to aquatic plants.<br> These oils can also contaminate water for 
                    drinking and other purposes. <br><br>As oil cleanup can be a long and expensive process, 
                    cleaning water that has been contaminated with oil is simply not an option. <br>
                    This means men, women, and children in less privileged countries are forced to 
                    use polluted water to drink, bathe, and cook.<p>

  <h1>Plastics</h1>
  <p>Today, plastics are used in all types of manufacturing ranging from the production 
    of clothing to car parts. As plastic is lightweight, <br>it is often washed away into
     rivers and oceans. <br><br>Plastic is also non-biodegradable, meaning it can last for decades
      while presenting a danger to marine animals. <br>Modern plastics also contain harmful
       chemicals that can seep into the water over time. Some types of plastic contain
        bisphenol. </p>

  <h1>Radioactive Waste</h1>
  <p>Exposure to radiation increases the risk of damage to cells, tissues, and DNA.
     Long-term exposure can result in serious issues like cancers, birth defects,
      leukemia,<br> genetic mutations, and immune and endocrine system disorders.<br><br>
       When factories release radioactivity into the air, soil, and water, it can 
       cause these problems and more in people who come into contact with the 
       radioactive waste. Radioactive waste can also last for many centuries
        making cleanup a major challenge. <br><br>If radioactive waste is not 
        disposed of properly, contaminants can spread to groundwater and surface 
        water.</p>
