          <h1>Wastewater treatment</h1>
          <p>Wastewater treatment consists of removing pollutants from wastewater through a physical,<br>
            chemical or biological process. The more efficient these processes are,<br>
            the cleaner the water becomes.</p>

          <h1>Green agriculture</h1>
          <p>Globally, agriculture accounts for 70% of water resources, so it is essential to have climate-friendly crops,<br>
            efficient irrigation that reduces the need for water and energy-efficient food production.<br>
            Green agriculture is also crucial to limit the chemicals that enter the water.</p>

          <h1>Stormwater management</h1>
          <p>“Stormwater management is the effort to reduce runoff of rainwater or melted snow into streets,<br>
            lawns and other sites and the improvement of water quality” according to the US Environmental Protection<br>
            Agency (EPA). It is important to avoid pollutants from contaminating <br>
            the water and helps to use water more efficiently.</p>

          <h1>Plastic waste reduction </h1>
          <p>80% of plastic in our oceans is from land sources. In order to reduce the amount of plastic <br>
            entering our ocean, we need to both reduce our use of plastic globally,<br>
             and to improve plastic waste management.</p>

          <h1> Water conservation </h1>
          <p>Without water conservation, we won’t go very far. It is central in making sure the <br>
            world has better access to clean water. It means being aware that <br>
            water is a scarce resource, taking care of it accordingly,<br>
            and managing it responsibly.</p>
